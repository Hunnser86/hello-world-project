# Hello World Project

 [View my page here.](https://hunnser86.github.io/hello-world-project/)

 ## What is the purpose of the project?

This project is designed to show some of what I have been learning thus far in my in my Deploma in Software Development.
This was a follow along module, teaching me how to set up a simple site that included HTML and CSS.
I was shown how to create a nav bar with links inside it, and how to display and size some images.

The technologies I used in this project, were HTML and CSS.  I used HTML to create the main structure of the site, and I used CSS to style it.

It is a very simple three page site, with the first page being the one displaying the images, and the next two to help demonstrate to me how to link pages together and prove that they work.
The images on the first page contain links to the Wiki pages for HTML and CSS.
